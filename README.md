# Welcome
This week I didn't have a specific Idea for a game so I made 3 minigames (to be honest, Pipes is so large it could be its own game).
Here is how to play them:

- **Minesweeper** - It works like a regular minesweeper (left click to check for bombs, right click to place a flag), but you don't uncover a large area at the start, so it's much harder.
- **Pipes** - The biggest game, in here you have to **connect pipes to points**:
  - First, pick a rotation in which you want your pipe to be placed, by **Left Clicking** on the icon on the bar below (hotbar).
  - **Drag and drop** the pipe from the icon to where you want to place it on the canvas (more accurately a container), you can only place the pipe **next to another pipe or specific point** (start point, checkpoints, endpoint).
  - Points with **lime borders** represent checkpoints. You first connect the pipes to them.
  - Connecting a pipe to checkpoint reveals **another checkpoint or an end** (a full red square).
  - You can remove the pipes by **right clicking** on them. You can rebuild your pipes in any order.
  - You win by connecting the the **start square (Green)** to the **end square (Red)**.
  - 
- **Plants** - In here you have:
  -  To cover as much of the soil as you can with seeds in **5 turns**.
  -  Gray squares are **rocks** - you can't plant on them.
  -  When you click a button, a plane will **plant seeds in a straight line** from that button.
  -  Win by **beating your own score** :).

# Authors note
Thank you for playing the game! Originaly it was supposed to be a 3 part game about farming (minesweeper was meant for finding hidden rocks, pipes was supposed to focus on irrigation systems and plants about planting the crops), but I run out of time and will because I had to learn from the scratch how to operate in a grid as opposed to a flexbox so it took a lot longer (mostly looking at stack overflow for answears).
