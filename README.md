# Welcome
This week I didn't have a a specific Idea for a game so I made 3 minigames (to be honest pipes is so large it could be its own game).
Here is how to play them:

- **Minesweeper** - It works like a regular minesweeper (left click to check for bombs, right click to place a flag), but you don't uncover a large area at the start, so it's much harder.
- **Pipes** - The biggest game, in here you have to connect pipes to points:
  - At first pick a rotation in which you want your pipe to be placed, by **Left Clicking** on the icon on the bar below (hot bar?).
  - Then **drag and drop** the pipe from the icon to where you want to place it on the canvas (more accurately a container), you can only place the pipe next to another pipe or specific point (start point, checkpoints, endpoint).
  - The points with the lime border represent checkpoints, you first have to connect the pipe to them to them.
  - Connecting a pipe to checkpoint reveals another checkpoint or an end (full red square).
  - You can remove the pipes by **right clicking** on them (You can rebuild your pipes, and the order of checkpoints doesn't matter).
  - You win by connecting the the start square to the end square.
- **Plants** - In here you have:
  -  to cover as much of the soil as you can with seeds in 5 turns.
  -  the gray squares are rocks you can't plant on them.
  -  when you click a button, a plane will plant seeds in a straight line from your button.
  -  In here you win by beating your own score :).
